notes networks 4.10.16

chapter 8: network security - guest lecturer
-principles of network security
-security in practice
  - toolkits we can use
    - applications, etc
*what is network security?*
-confidentiality - only sender and intended receiver should be able to read
-authentication - sender/receiver want to confirm identities
-message integrity - msg has not been modified
-access and availability - services remain usable/available to customers

attacks:
- eavesdropping - intercept messages
- insertion - put msgs into stream/connection
- impersonation - fake source address
- hijacking - take over ongoing connection
- DOS
^these are active attacks

encrypt messages
  - confidentiality

breaking encryption scheme
  - ciphertext only
  - known plaintext
    - probable-word

public-key encryption
- signing docs
- encrypting messages
modular arithmetic -_-
RSA is secure cos math

authenticity - digital signatures using public-key encryption
