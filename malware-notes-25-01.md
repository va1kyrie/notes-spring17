## Use of Legitimate Services in Illicit Activities

### Overview
- Evolution of cybercrime
  - illicit use of legitimate services
    - complicit (parking services)
    - compromised (watering holes)
    - complicit/abused (BPH - under submission)

### Domain Parking Services
- idle domains >>> display ads on domains
  - instead of figuring out best ad services, use domain parking services
  - don't have to make all decisions
- typical ecosystems: your domains >>> parking services >>> ad networks/traffic systems/others (like brand owners)

- fingerprinting monetization chains
  - malicious activities on both sides

### Watering Holes
- how legitimate services may be used/compromised by APTs in attacks
  - usually APTs
- challenging threat to look into because they're rather rare
  - not always announced even when they do happen
- analyze websites for use by employees at companies targeted
  - compromise employees' systems to compromise companies
  - these sites are legitimate, they get compromised.
- created profiles for websites they were watching -- looked for outlier changes
  - indicators that they might be a watering hole
- discovered 17 watering holes
- discovered 6 new attack vectors

### BPH (Bullet Proof Hosting)



# Q&A

data collection and getting hands dirty is the first thing you should think about

PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE -- especially in an investigative project like this
  - but it's important !!! someone who gets bored easily shouldn't do it but it's v. important.

even if you have policies in place, how do you enforce?

more practical question: if we do not have these policies/agreements in place, what are you going to do about it?
  prevention
  detection
it is so difficult to enforce regulations internationally - ex: malicious domains

important to understand why you are doing the work you do
  insight to provide to others
  follow your insight/guts/instinct

what does it point to? what is the new direction?
