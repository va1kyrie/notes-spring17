# Notes on Malware Project Proposal

- project
  - should show:
    - new
    - interesting
    - useful
    - feasibility

## My Project: IoT Threat Models
  - current state of IoT relies on traditional computer security techniques, which are even less effective than in the traditional computer realm due to the nature of the IoT
    - IoT devices do not have the processing power, often, for dedicated AV/malware detection
      - rely on assumption that no one will attack
  - IoT devices are embedded within the lives of the customers: traditional anonymization techniques do not work
    - the 'crowd' is one household
      - average US household (as of 2016) is 2.53 people ([US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/hhes/families/data/households.html))
        - the anonymity of the cloud is gone
    - and in some cases (such as one of The Mother's use cases), you *want* explicit identity
      - if Granma needs to take her pills, you want to know Granma is the one taking them. << identity here is very important
        - at the same time, Granma still very well may like her privacy
    - how to protect the identity of the individual?
