# Notes 6 March

- Assignment 2 due in 3 Fridays - but one of them is Spring Break (next)

- byte code >> useful program -- object-dump
  - give byte code for command
  - clearly shows you which byte code letters correspond to which operands in assembly.
    - ex: different versions of `mov` depending on hardware.
    - useful b/c later, once shell code written, going to need byte code
- need to understand how programs do and don't work and why

- base pointer: points to bottom of stack right at beginning of function call
